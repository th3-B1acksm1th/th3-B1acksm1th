- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @th3-B1acksm1th 

- ðŸ‘€ My interests are based in PYTHON and APP/Tool development. I enjoy building tools that make the programming
experience faster and increase flexibility. I also like making games. Who doesn't :)

- ðŸŒ± I have spent the last few years studying C#, HTML-JAVASCRIPT and finally PYTHON. I spent alot of time learning 
how to make web apps, but found myself gravitating back to making programs for use on windows. 

- On top of the PYTHON base language, I have studied the curses and tkinter modules extensivley (along with a few others) 
and I hope to continue learning. I feel that PYTHON is a strong language that extends flexibility to its user 
and I just find it enjoyable to work with.
